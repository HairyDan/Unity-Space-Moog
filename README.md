# Unity-Space-Moog

AKA 2 Player Asteroids.

This is a cheesy space shooter for 2 players on 1 keyboard.

There are a lot of placeholder graphics, especially UI and Terrain (fairly happy with particle effects currently).

The game is currently fairly bare-bones but quite fun for a few quick games with a friend.
